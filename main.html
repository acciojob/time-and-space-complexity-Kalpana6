	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the time required to execute the program.We should reduce the Time complexity of the code by optimizing it and make it more efficient. </p>
	<p><b>Space complexity </b>refers to the total amount of memory space used by a program. If a program takes an array of size n as input, the Space complexity of the program become O(n).</p>
